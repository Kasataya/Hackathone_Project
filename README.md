# Hackathone_Project
By combining campaign finance data with predictive AI and NLP, this project can highlight the often unseen influence of political donations. It would help the public and media explore potential financial motivations behind candidate decisions. The "Influence Score" could become a benchmark for transparency, empowering voters to make more informed choices.
